Okayy so first doubt is 
changing icon?

Hold control and click to go to the svg

icons in adnroid apps are in svg format 

.xml


Now you will find all these drawables in 

res > drawables folder

You can convert your png to svg 

using any online tools

We can use .png too because converting it into svg measn

we want all the layers of vector present (Its a graphic designer job so lets just jump to the point)

How to change icon


You can change target api /sdk from module settings

now our settings are changed 

but we made it on api level 33 so it will show compatiblity errors


      :app is currently compiled against android-27.

      Recommended action: Update this project to use a newer compileSdkVersion
      of at least 31, for example 33.


So it supports atleast api level 31 and up (our code and app structure)

In manifest target api is 31 it means we cant use less than 31 and our app is now setup on api level 33


If you were looking for api level 34, I dont know if its in new releases I am using 6 months old version
of android studio. you might have new api level option go try by yourself


First of all you asked for app id

its our package name

we can check it in our build.gradle file 








        applicationId "com.example.moneyapp" This is our appID we can change it while exporting


In build.gradle we have versions too


        versionCode 1
        versionName "1.0"


Version code is like when you want your app to have versions like 1.1 or 1.01 or anything

it depeends on you

but whenever you update code ( before deployement)

you need to mention the version (change the version)

The version code

lets suppose we made changes in this app for 6th time

we need to change version code to 6 if we want to promt users


thats all about app id and versions but
its your app id right?:

        applicationId "com.example.moneyapp"


you cant change "com"

you have to put com.packagename.modulename

so you can put any names after com 

com.aakash.thatapp 

Its just a string it doesnt have to do anything with 
development process so once we get on to uploading apps on google play store 
you will now the conflicts of app id

i can create 2 different apps with same app in locally but
cant put them on google play store 
thats all about app ids

wait

its Unit error let me check why its happening


Can we fix this error later, its giving me unit errors i will tell you why it happened
